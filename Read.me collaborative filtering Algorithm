Collaborative Filtering Algorithm

This algorithm generates personalized product recommendations based on user data and similarity to other users. It utilizes collaborative filtering techniques to provide relevant suggestions.

Usage:
1. Collect user data, including demographics, previous purchases, and explicit preferences.
2. Preprocess the data, ensuring it is in a suitable format for collaborative filtering.
3. Apply collaborative filtering techniques to generate product recommendations for each user.
4. Present the recommendations to the user based on their similarity to other users with similar preferences.
5. Continuously update and refine the recommendations based on new data.
