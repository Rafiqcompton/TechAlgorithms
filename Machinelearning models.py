# Step 1: Collect historical data

historical_data = [
    {"user_id": "User1", "product_id": "ProductA", "rating": 5, "interaction": "purchase"},
    {"user_id": "User1", "product_id": "ProductB", "rating": 4, "interaction": "view"},
    # Additional historical data...
]

# Step 2: Preprocess the data

# Convert historical data to suitable format for training
X = []
y = []

for data_point in historical_data:
    user_id = data_point["user_id"]
    product_id = data_point["product_id"]
    rating = data_point["rating"]

    # Extract relevant features from the data point
    features = [user_id, product_id]  # Additional features can be added

    # Append features and corresponding rating to the training data
    X.append(features)
    y.append(rating)

# Step 3: Train machine learning models

def train_models(X, y):
    # Train machine learning models to predict user preferences and behavior
    # Implementation depends on the chosen machine learning algorithms

    # Return the trained models
    models = {}

    return models

trained_models = train_models(X, y)

# Step 4: Provide personalized recommendations
user = "User1"
user_features = [user]  # Additional features can be added

def generate_recommendations(user_features, trained_models):
    # Utilize the trained models to generate personalized recommendations
    # Implementation depends on the specific machine learning algorithms

    # Return product recommendations for the user
    recommendations = []

    return recommendations

recommendations = generate_recommendations(user_features, trained_models)
print("Recommended products for", user, ":", recommendations)

# Step 5: Continuously update and retrain models based on new data
# Regularly collect new historical data and update the training data
# Retrain the machine learning models to incorporate new information
