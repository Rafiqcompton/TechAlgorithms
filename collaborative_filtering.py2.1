# Step 1: Collect user data

user_data = {
    "User1": {"purchase_history": ["ProductA", "ProductB", "ProductC"], "age": 30, "gender": "Male"},
    "User2": {"purchase_history": ["ProductA", "ProductD"], "age": 25, "gender": "Female"},
    # Additional user data...
}

# Step 2: Preprocess the data

# Convert user data to suitable format
user_matrix = []
product_set = set()

for user, data in user_data.items():
    user_vector = [0] * len(product_set)
    for product in data["purchase_history"]:
        if product not in product_set:
            product_set.add(product)
        user_vector[sorted(list(product_set)).index(product)] = 1
    user_matrix.append(user_vector)

# Step 3: Collaborative filtering

def generate_recommendations(user_matrix):
    # Apply collaborative filtering techniques to generate recommendations
    # Implementation depends on the chosen collaborative filtering algorithm

    # Return product recommendations for each user
    recommendations = {}

    return recommendations

recommendations = generate_recommendations(user_matrix)

# Step 4: Present recommendations to the user
user = "User1"
user_recommendations = recommendations[user]
print("Recommended products for", user, ":", user_recommendations)

# Step 5: Continuously update and refine recommendations based on new data
# Regularly collect new user data and update the user matrix
